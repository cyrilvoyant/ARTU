# Contributing to ARTU

Thanks for your interest! Quick guidelines:

1. Open an issue before starting large changes.
2. Create a descriptive branch: `feature/add-xyz` or `fix/readme-typo`.
3. Keep commits focused and with clear messages.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main` and explain the change.
5. A basic linter runs on PRs (Markdown/HTML).

If you want issue/PR templates or a code of conduct, I can add those too.
