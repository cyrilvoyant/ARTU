# ARTU
ARTU Predictive Method // Statistical Reference Method // Direct  Multi-Step  Forecast Strategy

- Five algorithms descriptions (pseudo-codes) allowing to make a benchmark for the forecast of meteorological time series,

- Dedicated matrices + code (.m files) concerning the ARTU method,

- unzip the K_alpha files =>  open the K_alpha.m scipt, exemples and descriptions are given => [K,alpha] = K_alpha(0.5,0.6,2) for K and alpha values corresponding to \rho(h)=0.5, \rho(2h)=0.6 and R=5%
