# ARTU
ARTU Predictive Method // Statistical Reference Method // Direct  Multi-Step  Forecast Strategy

- Five algorithms descriptions (pseudo-codes) allowing to make a benchmark for the forecast of meteorological time series,

- Dedicated matrices + code (Matlab files) concerning the ARTU method,

- Unzip the K_alpha files: 
-         =>  open the K_alpha.m scipt, exemples and descriptions are given, 
-         => [K,alpha] = K_alpha(0.5,0.6,2) for K and alpha values corresponding to $\Rho(h)$=0.5, Rho(2h)=0.6 and R=5%.
